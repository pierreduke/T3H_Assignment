                <p>
                    Jakarta is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Southeast Asia. Established in the
                    fourth
                    century as Sunda Kelapa, the city became an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom. At one
                    time, it
                    was the de facto capital of the Dutch East Indies, when it was known as Batavia. Jakarta was
                    officially a
                    city within West Java until 1960, when its official status was changed to a province with special
                    capital
                    region distinction. As a province, its government consists of five administrative cities and one
                    administrative regency.

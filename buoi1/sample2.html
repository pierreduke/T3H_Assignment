                    region distinction. As a province, its government consists of five administrative cities and one
                    administrative regency. Jakarta is an alpha world city and is the seat of the ASEAN secretariat,
                    Financial

                    numerous
                    Indonesian companies and multinational corporations are located in the city. In 2017, the city's GRP
